- Colored output 
- Hide results by return code, word numbers, line numbers, etc.
- Url encoding

- Proxy support 
- All parameter fuzzing
- etc

It was created to facilitate the task in web applications assessments, it's a tool by pentesters for pentesters ;)

## How does it works?

The tool is based on dictionaries or ranges, then you choose where you want to bruteforce just by replacing the value by the word FUZZ.
